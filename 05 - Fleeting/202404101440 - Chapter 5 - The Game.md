>The skills you acquire will determine the challenges you take on. Those challenges will expand your awareness of profitable opportunities

**The more skills you’re working on, the more challenges you can take.**

**The reason why I still have no job may be related to the fact the my skills are not enough for that challenge.**

**But even if I stop from trying to pass this challenge and start working on my skills, how can I know that this amount of skills are enough for passing a challenge?**

>If you can mold your mind to see a situation from what it is, <u>a game</u>,  by creating a beneficial end goal, constructing a path to get there, and deciphering the most <u>advantageous action</u> you can take, even mundane situations become enjoyable

Achieved goal  is a sequence of focused actions that make it possible to achieve

All your actions are influenced by need, not want, to go on

> The collective unconscious get you into this mess. The conscious individual can get you out

**You’re don’t know what the problems are because you’re young**

**You’re told how you should act to solve problems you don’t know about**

**When you encounter those problems => you don’t think of them. You act as you’ve been told.** <u>You act unconsciously</u>.

Be aware, be conscious about your problems as they are the beginning of the conscious actions.

Abstract goal produce hesitation
Abstract goal decomposition creates path filled with projects

**Getting a job can be challenging. Like a boss in the game. At the beginning you cannot be prepared well enough to fight it. But the only way to know that you truly not ready for that => fight it.** After the fight you will gain experience and understanding. Since the challenge is too complicated for you - you should seek not a win but understanding how to win.

>When you’re bored the minds tends to disorder. Unless you find a system, a game to form the structure of situation

**If spouse likes shopping in a vintage stores and you don’t - your mind becomes bored. Your spouse is in a flow and you’re not. But when you start to create a system, a game like finding the most antique piece of cloth - you become part of this game and you aware of it, so your mind will not get distracted.**
