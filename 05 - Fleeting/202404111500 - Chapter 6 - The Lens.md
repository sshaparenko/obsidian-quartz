**We identify our self  based on our experience, ideologies and dogmas. With that we tend to think that we are static. Static in our thoughts and opinions. But those thoughts are based on the forms of the outer world. And outer world is never static. So while the world is moving and changing - we stay static with our ideologies and dogmas.**

>Unless your mind is engaged with a thought, task or stimulus it will wander off in a negative direction, anxiety or boredom. When we allow randomness into our lives, negativity increases in potential
