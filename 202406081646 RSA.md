## RSA Algorithm

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a pair of keys:
- **Private Key:** Kept secret and used to decrypt data or sign messages
- **Public Key:** Shared publicly and used to encrypt data or verify signatures

## Use Cases for RSA Keys
- **SSH Access:** RSA keys are commonly used for SSH authentication. The public key is added to `~/.ssh/auhtorized_keys` file on remote server and the private key is used by the client to authenticate
- **Digital Signatures:** RSA keys can be used to sign data digitally to ensure integrity and authenticity
- **Encryption:** RSA keys can be used to encrypt sensitive data
