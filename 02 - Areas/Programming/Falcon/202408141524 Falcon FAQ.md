`TTY Device` - `UART` driver + line discipline instance + TTY driver

Each terminal session in Unix-line OS is associated with a `TTY Device` (`/dev/tty1` `/dev/pts/0`). These devices handle IO for terminal sessions.

By monitoring the TTY devices you can capture the commands executed in each terminal session

### Monitoring TTY for Commands: Interception via PTY
`PTY` (pseudo-terminals) can be used to create a wrapper around the shell. This will allow to capture IO going through the terminal

To wrap a shell with PTY using it’s PID yo need:
1. Every shell process has associated TTY device. You'll first need to find the TTY associated with the shell process using PID
2. This info can be found under `/proc` directory. 

for each terminal there is a tty device. We could find which tty represents witch terminal session by writing tty command in terminal

### Docker on Linux architecture
The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) and Docker CLI (`docker`) works together in a client-server architecture. Although they function as two separate components, they interact closely to provide a seamless Docker experience.

#### Docker Daemon

**Role:** The Docker daemon is the server that performs the heavy lifting, managing Docker containers, images, volumes and networks. 

It listens for API requests (via HTTP or UNIX socket) from clients, such as the Docker CLI

**How it works:**
- The daemon continuously runs on the background
- It listens a Unix socket or a TCP port for incoming commands from Docker CLI
- Daemon handles container lifecycle
- It’s responsible for communication with Linux kernel via containerization techniques
#### Docker CLI

**Role:** Docker CLI is a command-line interface that user uses to communicate with Docker daemon via sending commands

**How it works:**
- When you type `docker run`, the CLI communicates with the Docker daemon through the Docker API. The Daemon then processes the request
- The CLI does not actually do work; it simply forwards user commands to daemon


#### UNIX domain sockets (local communication)

**Description:** Unix domain sockets allow for local inter-process communication (IPC) between processes on the same machine and typically occurs through a file in the filesystem `/var/run/mydaemon.sock`

**Use Case:** This is a great choice when CLI and daemon are running on the same machine. Docker uses it by default with its daemon (`/var/run/docker.sock`)


**Security:**
- **File Permissions:** You can secure UNIX sockets by setting appropriate file permissions.
- **`SELinux` or `AppArmour`**: These security frameworks can further limit which processes are allowed to access the socket

**Complexity to secure:** Low. UNIX domain sockets are secure by default as they are confined to the local machine

### how to manage pty and tty buffers in golang?
A low-level question!

In Go, when interacting with a terminal device (tty) or a pseudoterminal (pty), you'll need to 
manage the input/output buffers to ensure proper communication. Here's a high-level overview of 
how to do it:

**TTY Buffer Management**

1. **Set up the tty**: When opening a tty device, Go will automatically allocate a buffer for 
reading and writing. You can adjust the buffer size using the `os.Setbuf` function.
2. **Read from the tty**: When reading from a tty, you'll typically use the `os.Stdin.Read` 
method to read from the buffer. Make sure to check the return value to see if there was an error 
or if the end of file (EOF) has been reached.
3. **Write to the tty**: When writing to a tty, you'll typically use the `os.Stdout.Write` method 
to write to the buffer. Ensure that the data is properly formatted and terminated (e.g., with 
newline characters).
4. **Flush the tty buffer**: To ensure that data is actually sent to the terminal device, call 
the `os.Fdflush` function on the file descriptor associated with the tty.

**Flushing the TTY**

In the context of I/O operations, "flushing" refers to the process of ensuring that any buffered 
data is written to its final destination (e.g., disk, network, or terminal device). In other 
words, flushing guarantees that all pending writes are completed, and the buffer is empty.

When you write data to a file descriptor (like a tty), Go typically buffers the output. This 
means that the data is not immediately sent to the terminal device but instead stored in memory 
for efficiency reasons. The buffer is then periodically flushed to the underlying device, which 
can be important for ensuring that your program's output is properly displayed on the terminal.

Flushing the TTY is crucial when working with terminal devices, as it ensures that any buffered 
output is immediately sent to the terminal and displayed correctly. Failure to flush the TTY can 
result in:

* Output not being displayed immediately
* Data loss or corruption due to buffering issues

In Go, you can flush a tty buffer using the `os.Fdflush` function, which takes an `int` file 
descriptor as its argument. This function is specifically designed for flushing buffered output 
to a terminal device.

**PTY Buffer Management**

1. **Set up the pty**: When opening a pty, Go will automatically allocate a pair of buffers: one 
for reading (master) and another for writing (slave). You can adjust the buffer sizes using the 
`os.Setbuf` function.
2. **Read from the master**: When reading from the master side of a pty, you'll typically use the 
`os.Stdin.Read` method to read from the buffer. Make sure to check the return value to see if 
there was an error or if the end of file (EOF) has been reached.
3. **Write to the slave**: When writing to the slave side of a pty, you'll typically use the 
`os.Stdout.Write` method to write to the buffer. Ensure that the data is properly formatted and 
terminated (e.g., with newline characters).
4. **Flush the pty buffers**: To ensure that data is actually sent between the master and slave 
sides of the pty, call the `os.Fdflush` function on both file descriptors associated with the 
pty.

**Additional Tips**

* When dealing with ptys, be aware that the master side may not always receive data written to 
the slave side immediately. You may need to use additional mechanisms (e.g., signals) to ensure 
proper synchronization.
* Always check the return values from I/O operations to handle errors and EOF conditions 
properly.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively manage pty and tty buffers in 
your Go program.
