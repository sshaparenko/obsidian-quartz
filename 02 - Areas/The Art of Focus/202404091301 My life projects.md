# My Life Projects
***

Since for now I see some of my aspects that I want and don’t want in my life, the main `Problem` and the main `Project` that I should develop is => `to have a job`

The only way to have a job offer is to stand out from a large amount of CVs. That’s can be done by accumulating more experience in more areas than others.

> Progression should by vertical and horizontal. **Amount of techs should increase in parallel with knowledge in each of techs.**

## The best way to learn something is to not learn. Instead you should do. Start a project and learn everything while doing it


A project should acquire new knowledge in areas that I know something about and something absolutely new, that I never knew before.

This project should be a product application with both web and mobile versions. Priority One! => Web App

Blogging Platform: **Build a blogging platform where users can create and publish blog posts. Utilize Spring Boot for the backend RESTful API, Spring Data JPA for data persistence, and Spring Security for user authentication. Implement features like user profiles, commenting, and tagging.**
